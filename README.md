### Key Features of the Dynamic World System:

* Infinite World: The world expands as the player explores
* Block Persistence: Each block maintains its state (entity positions, etc.) when revisited
* Safe Spawning: When generating new blocks, a safe area is created around player entry points
* Transition Effects: Smooth
